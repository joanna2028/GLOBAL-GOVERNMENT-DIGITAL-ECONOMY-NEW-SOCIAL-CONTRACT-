Do you think 51% of the population is more right than wrong?

What the 51% of people believe, is that the truth ? The mayority is right? 

If you got 70% of population believing something is even more truth?

I do not agree, 

Are people well informed, are people thinking critically, objetively? 

We always need to come back to....

Where we go from the wisdom of Crowds to the madness of Crowds...?
